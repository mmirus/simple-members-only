# simple-members-only
Secure parts of your WordPress site for logged-in users only.

This plugin becomes useful as part of a full security/members system when combined with:

1. Custom roles (created however you prefer).
2. Role checks where needed in your templates (for example, in your header file to display alternative menus based on the user's role).

## Features

* Option to specify required user roles for pages and posts.
* Ability to set alternate versions for different roles on pages and posts.
* Show message and login form when security check fails.
* Option to redirect to home page when security check fails.
